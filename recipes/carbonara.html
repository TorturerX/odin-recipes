        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>Carbonara made <em>without eggs!</em>, but with milk and cream instead</p>
        
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (8 ounces) package of linguine pasta</li>
            <li>1 cup of frozen peas</li>
            <li>5 slices of bacon</li>
            <li>1 clove of garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 cup of milk</li>
            <li>1/2 (8 ounce) package of cream cheese</li>
            <li>1/4 cup of grated parmesan cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook the linguine at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes, adding peas in the 
                last minute of cooking. Drain and keep warm in a bowl.</li>
            <li>Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Transfer the bacon to paper 
                towels, reserving 1 tablespoon of drippings in the skillet.</li>
            <li>Add garlic to the skillet; saute for 1 minute. Reduce heat to low and stir in milk and cream cheese until blended.</li>
            <li>Crumble bacon and add to the linguine along with sauce and Parmesan cheese; stir to coat.</li>
        </ol>
